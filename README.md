Prob1

Step 1:Write a program that takes in grades entered by the user.  
Step 2: Use a for loop to sum up the grades.

Prob2

Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many positive and negative integers have been read, and computes the total average of the input values(not counting zeros).  Your program ends with the input 0. 

* This will use a while, if and else if

Sample output: Enter an integer, the input ends if it is a 0: 1 2 -5 -8 7 0
The number of positives is: 3
The number of negatives is: 2
The total is:
The average is:  

Prob3
(Find the highest scores)
Step 1: Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students and each student's name and score, and finally 
Step 2: displays the student with the highest score. 
*Use the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name(String) instead of using the nextLine() method. 

Prob4
Write a program that displays all the numbers from 100 to 1,000 (10 per line, that are divisible by 5 and 6.  Numbers should be separated by a space. 
		 
		Hint: you will use a for loop and an if statement nested under the for loop

Prob5
Write code which prints every number from 1 to 20 a number of times equal to the number itself (e.g. one 1, two 2's...). Every individual number printed should be separated by a space, and there should be a new line each time the number changes. You should use nested loops to produce your output (it will result in far less code).

Partial sample run:

1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
........

Prob 6
Build a nested for loop that looks like this
****                                                                
***                                                                 
**                                                                    
*
